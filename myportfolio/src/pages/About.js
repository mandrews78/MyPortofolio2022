    <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Michael Andrews. I have about 17 years of experience in Information Technology. Coding is fun but has also been a 
                challenge for me. I have a system administration and data center 
                background and have never had to code. In supporting various linux systems, 
                I have a need to understand coding. Since the Information Technology 
                industry is moving to mostly cloud based solutions. I decided to 
                challenge myself and aquire the skill of web development. I hope 
                that this course helps me in my career growth.</p>
